# The Bugbu Remix - Budget BambuLab P1/X1 Style Printer with Enhanced Features

Introduction:
Welcome to the Bugbu Remix, a modified version of the BugBu 210 printer originally created by @rolls17.
 This remix aims to enhance the printer's versatility while keeping the base design intact.
 We are grateful to @rolls17 and all the supportive members on Discord for their contributions and guidance throughout this project.

Modifications:

>Triple Z-Axis Bed: We have added a Triple Z-Axis Bed with z-tilt functionality, inspired by prosumer machines. This enhancement ensures better bed leveling and printing accuracy. The Triple Z-Axis design uses POM v-groove wheels for smooth operation.

>Acrylic Printer Enclosure: To provide a more controlled printing environment and reduce external interferences, we have included Acrylic Printer enclosure panels. The panels feature a hinged front door for easy access and maintenance. (Note: The top hood is currently under development and will be added soon.)

>Versatile Carriage: The carriage in the Bugbu Remix is designed to accept Voron Stealthburner/Afterburner hotend/extruder assemblies. This upgrade allows for a wider range of printing possibilities and material options.

>*Rear Acrylic Electronics Box: (Coming Soon) We have a rear acrylic electronics box in the pipeline, which will further enhance the printer's aesthetics and organization.*
