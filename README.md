# The Bugbu X1 - Elevating the Budget BambuLab P1 Killer with Enhanced Features

Meet the Bugbu Remix, a dynamic evolution of the BugBu 210 printer, conceived by the creative mind of @rolls17. My remix is driven by the vision to expand the printer's capabilities while maintaining its core essence. As we embark on this journey, we extend our gratitude to @rolls17 and the collaborative spirits within our Discord community for their unwavering support and guidance.

Modifications:

>Triple Z-Axis Bed: We have added a Triple Z-Axis Bed with z-tilt functionality, inspired by prosumer machines. This enhancement ensures better bed leveling and printing accuracy. The Triple Z-Axis design uses POM v-groove wheels for smooth operation.

>Acrylic Printer Enclosure: In pursuit of a controlled and interference-resistant printing environment, we have incorporated Acrylic Printer Enclosure panels. Featuring a front door equipped with a hinge mechanism and a swiveling acrylic top, these additions provide convenient access and facilitate maintenance. This is particularly advantageous for materials that benefit from a heated or insulated enclosure.

>Versatile Carriage: The carriage in the Bugbu Remix is designed to accept Voron Stealthburner/Afterburner hotend/extruder assemblies. This upgrade allows for a wider range of printing possibilities and material options.

>Rear Acrylic Electronics Box: We have a rear acrylic electronics box in the pipeline, which will further enhance the printer's aesthetics and organization.*
